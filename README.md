VSCode-PVS is a new integrated development environment for creating, evaluating and verifying PVS specifications.
The environment redefines the way developers interact with PVS, and better aligns the PVS front-end to the functionalities provided by development environments used by software developers.

## Requirements
- Linux or MacOS operating system
- NodeJS (v12.16.1 or greater) https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Visual Studio Code (v1.32.3 or greater) https://code.visualstudio.com

## Installation instructions
VSCode-PVS can be installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or from GitHub.


**Automatic installation from Visual Studio Code Marketplace**
- Search `pvs` in https://marketplace.visualstudio.com and select `install`

**Manual installation from GitHub**
1. Download the .vsix file of VSCode-PVS from [github](https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/releases).
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar 
3. Click on the `...` menu in the title bar, and use `Install from VSIX` to select the downloaded .vsix file

>Note: When installing VSCode-PVS for the first time, it will check if PVS Allegro v7.1.0 is present on your system. If not, VSCode-PVS will show a dialog that allows you to download PVS.

>Note: If you have used earlier releases of VSCode-PVS (`< 1.0.26`), you will need to download and install the latest version of PVS and NASALib. You can do this in VSCode-PVS, with the commands `M-x install-pvs` and `M-x install-nasalib`. 


## Updating VSCode-PVS
VSCode-PVS will be automatically updated every time we publish a new release in the marketplace.

All settings and preferences will be maintained when installing a new release.

If you would like to perform manual updates or try out nightly builds, you can download the .vsix file from [github](https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/releases).

## Functionalities
The main functionalities provided by the environment are as follows:
- **Syntax highlighting**: PVS keywords and library functions are automatically highlighted.
- **Autocompletion and code snippets**: Tooltips suggesting function names and language keywords are automatically presented in the editor when placing the mouse over a symbol name. Code snippets are provided for frequent modeling blocks, e.g., if-then-else.

- **Hover information for symbol definitions**: Hover boxes providing information about identifiers are automatically displayed when the user places the cursor over an identifier.
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-hover.gif" width="600">

- **Go-to definition**: Click on the name of the identifier while holding down the Ctrl key to jump to the location where the identifier is declared.

- **Live diagnostics**: Parsing is automatically performed in the background, and errors are reported in-line in the editor. Problematic expressions are underlined with red wavy lines. Tooltips presenting the error details are shown when the user places the cursor over the wavy lines.

- **Workspace Explorer**: Interactive tree view showing all theories in the current workspace, name and status of theorems and typecheck conditions.

- **Proof Explorer + Integrated Terminal**: Interactive tree view for viewing and editing the current proof. An integrated terminal allows interaction with the theorem prover. Auto-completion is provided (using the TAB key) for prover commands, as well as access to the commands history.

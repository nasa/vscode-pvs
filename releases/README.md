   b. Alternatively, if you don't have PVS 8.0 installed in your computer, follow these steps:

      * Install Emacs (version 19 or newer): we recommend to use Aquamacs, which can be installed by typing `brew install aquamacs` in a terminal shell. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can download it from [here](https://brew.sh/).

      * Install some Common Lisp framework, for example, SBCL; the easiest way to get SBCL is via brew: `brew install sbcl`.
      
      * Finally, click on "Default Installation" in the first pop-up.

5. NASALib: after checking PVS is installed, VSCode-PVS will ask if you want to install the NASA Library (NASALib).

% We still have the basic idea of schemas a sets of bindings which turns up in PVS
% models for schemas being sets of records.
% When the schemas are simply schema types
% (as Z calls them, i.e. schemas with predicate part "true") then the schemas
% are just record types, because these types are sets of records, i.e. sets of bindings
% in Z

% Then, when the predicate part of a schema is not just "true", i.e. when not
% every binding is in the set denoted by the schema, i.e. when not every record in
% the corresponding PVS type is in the set, then we use dependent subtyping with the
% counterpart to a Z predicate part
% to restrict the records in the set, just as Z does

% Sadly we cannot use "primes" in identifiers in PVS :( so we use underscore

% Now, hiding of types in PVS.....!!!!!
% It's already apparent that there's no counterpart to the schema calculus in PVS
% (which is OK since there are no schemas :) ) so hiding (existential quantification
% over schemas) needs to be modelled inside the set brackets in the predicate part...
% There is a certain amount of regularity to this, given the above...

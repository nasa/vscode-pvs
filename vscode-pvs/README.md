VSCode-PVS is a new integrated development environment for creating, evaluating and verifying PVS specifications.
The environment redefines the way developers interact with PVS, and better aligns the PVS front-end to the functionalities provided by development environments used for programming languages such as C++ and Java.

## Requirements
- Linux or Intel Mac
- NodeJS (v20.11.1 or greater) https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Visual Studio Code (v1.76.0 or greater) https://code.visualstudio.com

## Installation instructions
VSCode-PVS can be installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or from GitHub.

>Note: When installing VSCode-PVS for the first time, the extension will check if PVS Allegro v7.1.0 is present on your system. If PVS Allegro is not present, VSCode-PVS will show a dialog and try to download and install PVS Allegro. Should the extension fail to download and install PVS Allegro, try to download and install PVS Allegro manually from https://pvs.csl.sri.com/. Should everything else fail, please report the problem on the [PVS group on Google](https://groups.google.com/g/pvs-group), we will help you out.

**Automatic installation of VSCode-PVS from the Marketplace (recommended)**
- Search `pvs` in https://marketplace.visualstudio.com and select `install`
<br><br><img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/how-to-install-vscode-pvs-from-marketplace.gif" width="600">

**Manual installation of VSCode-PVS from GitHub**
1. Download the .vsix file of VSCode-PVS from [github](https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/releases).
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar 
3. Click on the `...` menu in the title bar, and use `Install from VSIX` to select the downloaded .vsix file

<br>

**Installation of PVS Allegro**

If PVS Allegro is not already installed on your machine, VSCode-PVS will automatically download and install it. Should VSCode-PVS fail to download and install PVS Allegro, please try the following two steps:
1. Download PVS Allegro v7.1.0 for [MacOS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/license.html?tgzfile=pvs7.1.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro.tgz) or [Linux](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/license.html?tgzfile=pvs-6.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro.tgz)
2. Follow the installation instructions reported in the `INSTALL` file included in the downloaded PVS package. 

Once PVS Allegro is installed on your machine, you can link up PVS and VSCode-PVS by indicating the location of the PVS executables in the VSCode-PVS settings.

## Updating VSCode-PVS
VSCode-PVS is automatically updated every time we publish a new release in the marketplace.
- All settings and preferences will be maintained when installing a new release.
- If you would like to perform manual updates, e.g., to try out pre-releases, you can download and install the .vsix files posted on the [PVS google group](https://groups.google.com/g/pvs-group).


## Functionalities
The main functionalities provided by the environment are as follows:
- **Syntax highlighting**: PVS keywords and library functions are automatically highlighted.
- **Autocompletion and code snippets**: Tooltips suggesting function names and language keywords are automatically presented in the editor when placing the mouse over a symbol name. Code snippets are provided for frequent modeling blocks, e.g., if-then-else. 
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-autocompletion.gif" width="600">

- **Hover information for symbol definitions**: Hover boxes providing information about identifiers are automatically displayed when the user places the cursor over an identifier.
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-hover.gif" width="600">

- **Go-to definition**: Click on the name of the identifier while holding down the Ctrl key to jump to the location where the identifier is declared.
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-goto-definition.gif" width="600">

- **Live diagnostics**: Parsing is automatically performed in the background, and errors are reported in-line in the editor. Problematic expressions are underlined with red wavy lines. Tooltips presenting the error details are shown when the user places the cursor over the wavy lines.

- **Workspace Explorer**: Interactive tree view showing all theories in the current workspace, name and status of theorems and typecheck conditions.
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-theory-explorer.gif" width="600">

- **Proof Explorer + Integrated Terminal**: Interactive tree view for viewing and editing the current proof. An integrated terminal allows interaction with the theorem prover. Auto-completion is provided (using the TAB key) for prover commands, as well as access to the commands history.
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-proof-explorer.gif" width="600">

- **Proof Mate**: Interactive proof helper for suggesting proof commands, sketching proof attempts, and repairing broken proofs. Proof Mate provides a playground for copying, editing, and writing of proof sections without restriction, and during a live proof session.

- **Plot Executable Functions**: Executable functions that return a list of real numbers can be rendered in a plot diagram (see examples in [helloworld.pvs](https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/blob/master/vscode-pvs/examples/helloworld/helloworld.pvs))
<br><br> <img src="https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/vscode-pvs-plot-expression.gif" width="600">

- **Search NASALib**: Search definitions and theorems in [NASALib](https://github.com/nasa/pvslib), an extensive PVS library developed and maintained by the NASA Langley Formal Methods Team.

- **Prototype Builder**: Build interactive visual prototypes to demonstrate the behavior of executable PVS specifications (see also [pvsio-web prototype examples](https://github.com/pvsioweb/examples/tree/5ac4fdb40bcd489b8a28b0e42c6bf32fa94577ee))

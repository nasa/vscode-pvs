# VSCode-PVS: An Integrated Development Environment for the Prototype Verification System
VSCode-PVS is a new integrated development environment for creating, evaluating and verifying PVS specifications.
The environment redefines the way developers interact with PVS, and better aligns the PVS front-end to the functionalities provided by development environments used by software developers.

## Functionalities
The main functionalities provided by the environment are as follows:
- **Syntax highlighting**: PVS keywords and library functions are automatically highlighted.
- **Autocompletion and code snippets**: Tooltips suggesting function names and language keywords are automatically presented in the editor when placing the mouse over a symbol name. Code snippets are provided for frequent modeling blocks, e.g., if-then-else.
- **Hover information for symbol definitions**: Hover boxes providing information about identifiers are automatically displayed when the user places the cursor over an identifier.
- **Go-to definition**: Click on the name of the identifier while holding down the Ctrl key to jump to the location where the identifier is declared.
- **Peek definitions**: Symbol definitions can be shown in mini editors embedded in the current view.
- **Live diagnostics**: Parsing is automatically performed in the background, and errors are reported in-line in the editor. Problematic expressions are underlined with red wavy lines. Tooltips presenting the error details are shown when the user places the cursor over the wavy lines.
- **Outline View**: Interactive tree view showing the outline of the pvs file open in the editor. Point-and-click actions can be used to jump to definitions.
- **Workspace Explorer**: Interactive tree view showing all theories in the current workspace, name and status of theorems and typecheck conditions.
- **Proof Explorer**: Interactive tree view for viewing and editing the current proof.
- **Prover Terminal**: An integrated terminal allows interaction with the theorem prover. Auto-completion is provided (using the TAB key) for prover commands, as well as access to the commands history.
- **Proof Mate**: Helper designed to suggest proof commands that can be used to make progress with the current proof.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio Code (v1.32.3 or greater) https://code.visualstudio.com
- NodeJS (v12.16.1 or greater) https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Java JDK (1.8 or greater) https://openjdk.java.net
- PVS Allegro (7.1 or greater) http://www.csl.sri.com/users/owre/drop/pvs-snapshots

## Installation instructions
1. Download the latest release of VSCode-PVS from the [github repository](../releases)
2. Install VSCode-PVS in Visual Studio Code: Extensions tab -> "..." menu -> "Install from VSIX”, and select the downloaded .vsix file
3. Have fun using the extension!

## Updating VSCode-PVS
When a new release of VSCode-PVS is available in the [github repository](releases), download the new release and install it in Visual Studio Code:

- Extensions tab -> "..." menu -> "Install from VSIX”, and select the downloaded .vsix file

All settings and preferences from the previous version of VSCode-PVS will be maintained.

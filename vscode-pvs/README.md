# Welcome to VSCode-PVS!
VSCode-PVS is a new integrated development environment for creating, evaluating and verifying PVS specifications. The environment redefines the way developers interact with PVS, and better aligns the PVS front-end to the functionalities provided by development environments used by software developers.

 ## Functionalities
- [Syntax highlighting](): PVS keywords and library functions are automatically highlighted.
- [Autocompletion and code snippets](): Tooltips suggesting function names and language keywords are automatically presented in the editor when placing the mouse over a symbol name. Code snippets are provided for frequent modeling blocks, e.g., if-then-else.
- [Hover information for symbol definitions](): Hover boxes providing information about identifiers are automatically displayed when the user places the cursor over an identifier.
- [Go-to definition](): Click on the name of the identifier while holding down the Ctrl key to jump to the location where the identifier is declared.
- [Peek definitions](): Symbol definitions can be shown in mini editors embedded in the current view.
- [Live diagnostics](): Parsing is automatically performed in the background, and errors are reported in-line in the editor. Problematic expressions are underlined with red wavy lines. Tooltips presenting the error details are shown when the user places the cursor over the wavy lines.
- [Outline View](): Interactive tree view showing the outline of the pvs file open in the editor. Point-and-click actions can be used to jump to definitions.
- [Workspace Explorer](): Interactive tree view showing all theories in the current workspace, name and status of theorems and typecheck conditions.
- [Proof Explorer](): Interactive tree view for viewing and editing the current proof.
- [Prover Terminal](): An integrated terminal for interacting with the theorem prover. Auto-completion is provided (using the TAB key) for prover commands, as well as access to the commands history.
- [Proof Mate](): Helper tool, designed to suggest proof commands that can be used to make progress with the current proof.
- [Prototype Builder](): Rapid prototyping toolkit, for building interactive visual simulations based on PVS specifications.
